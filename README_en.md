# Flaskify

Simple Python library for super-fast API building and sharing for purpose of hackathon.

### Introduce

Flaskify is Python-based tool for build fundamental skeleton code for Flask when you want to make service back-end API quickly, and make Markdown document (`.md`) for sharing your API to your team members or managing on Github. This project has made when I was attending in [Startup Weekend](http://appcenter.kr/archives/category/startupweekend). 

_Development is still in progress; It will be little bit unstable._

### Usage

I provide one `.py` file for use this tool. Here is your guide:

```shell
python flaskify.py <JSON file>  # Normal (app.py file saved on your dir)
python flaskify.py <JSON file> -c  # Normal + TODO Memo
python flaskify.py <JSON file> -m  # Normal + Markdown API Document
```
